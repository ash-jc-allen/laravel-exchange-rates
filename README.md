## Overview

A simple Laravel package used for interacting with the [exchangeratesapi.io](http://exchangeratesapi.io) API. 'Laravel Exchange Rates'
allow you to get the latest or historical exchange rates and convert monetary values between different currencies.

## Installation

You can install the package via Composer:

```bash
composer require ashallendesign/laravel-exchange-rates
```

The package has been developed and tested to work with the following minimum requirements:

- PHP 7.2
- Laravel 6

## Getting Your API Key

As of 1st April 2021, the exchangeratesapi.io now requires an API key to use the service. To get an API key, head over to
[https://exchangeratesapi.io/pricing](https://exchangeratesapi.io/pricing). You can sign up for free or use the paid tiers.

Please note that at the time of writing this, you will need to be on at least the 'Basic' plan to make request via HTTPS. You
will also be required to have at least the 'Professional' plan to use the ` convertBetweenDateRange() ` and ` exchangeRateBetweenDateRange() `
that this package offers.

You will also be required to have at least the 'Basic' paid plan to use ` exchangeRate() ` and ` convert() ` methods offered by
this package due to the fact that the free plan does not allow setting a base currency when converting.

## Configuration

### Publish the Config and Migrations
You can publish the package's config file and database migrations (so that you can make changes to them) by using the following command:
```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="AshAllenDesign\LaravelExchangeRates\Providers\ExchangeRatesProvider"
```

Add the necessary configuration keys in your `.env`:

``` dotenv
EXCHANGE_RATES_API_URL=https://api.apilayer.com/exchangerates_data
EXCHANGE_RATES_API_PARAM=apikey
EXCHANGE_RATES_API_KEY={Your-API-Key-Here}
```

## Usage

### Methods
#### Available Currencies
``` php
$exchangeRates = new ExchangeRate();
$exchangeRates->currencies();
```

#### Exchange Rate
##### Getting the Rate Between Two Currencies
To get the exchange for one currency to another, you can use the ``` ->exchangeRate() ``` method. When doing this, 
you can pass the currency code as a string as the second parameter. The ``` ->exchangeRates() ``` method will then
return a string containing the exchange rate.

The example below shows how to get the exchange rate from 'GBP' to 'EUR' for today.

```php
$exchangeRates = new ExchangeRate();
$result = $exchangeRates->exchangeRate('GBP', 'EUR');

// $result: '1.10086'
```

Note: If a Carbon date is passed as the third parameter, the exchange rate for that day will be returned (if valid).
If no date is passed, today's exchange rate will be used.

##### Getting the Rate Between More Than Two Currencies
It is possible to get the exchange rates for multiple currencies in one call. This can be particularly useful if you are needing
to get many exchange rates at once and do not want to multiple API calls.

To do this, you can use ``` ->exchangeRate() ``` method and pass an array of currency code strings as the second parameter.
This will return the an array containing the exchange rates as strings.

The example below shows how to get the exchange rates from 'GBP' to 'EUR' and 'USD' for today.

```php
$exchangeRates = new ExchangeRate();
$result = $exchangeRates->exchangeRate('GBP', ['EUR', 'USD']);

// $result: [
//     'EUR' => '1.10086',
//     'USD' => '1.25622'
// ];
```

#### Exchange Rates Between Date Range
##### Getting the Rates Between Two Currencies
To get the exchange rates between two currencies between a given date range, you can use the ``` ->exchangeRateBetweenDateRange() ```
method. When doing this, you can pass the currency code as a string as the second parameter. The method will then return
an array containing the exchange rates.

The example below shows how to get the exchange rates from 'GBP' to 'EUR' for the past 3 days. 

```php
$exchangeRates = new ExchangeRate();
$result = $exchangeRates->exchangeRateBetweenDateRange('GBP', 'EUR', Carbon::now()->subWeek(), Carbon::now());

// $result: [
//     '2020-07-07' => 1.1092623405
//     '2020-07-08' => 1.1120625424
//     '2020-07-09' => 1.1153867604
// ];
```

##### Getting the Rates Between More Than Two Currencies
To get the exchange rates for multiple currencies in one call, you can pass an array of currency codes strings as the second
parameter to the ``` ->exchangeRateBetweenDateRange() ``` method.

The example below shows how to get the exchange rates from 'GBP' to 'EUR' and 'USD' for the past 3 days. 

```php
$exchangeRates = new ExchangeRate();
$result = $exchangeRates->exchangeRateBetweenDateRange('GBP', ['EUR', 'USD'], Carbon::now()->subDays(3), Carbon::now());

// $result: [
//     '2020-07-07' => [
//         'EUR' => 1.1092623405,
//         'USD' => 1.2523571825,
//      ],
//     '2020-07-08' => [
//         'EUR' => 1.1120625424,
//         'USD' => 1.2550737853,
//      ],
//     '2020-07-09' => [
//         'EUR' => 1.1153867604,
//         'USD' => 1.2650716636,
//      ],
// ];
```

#### Convert Currencies
When passing in the monetary value (first parameter) that is to be converted, it's important that you pass it in the lowest
denomination of that currency. For example, £1 GBP would be passed in as 100 (as £1 = 100 pence).

##### Converting Between Two Currencies
Similar to how you can get the exchange rate from one currency to another, you can also convert a monetary value from one
currency to another. To do this you can use the ``` ->convert() ``` method.

The example below shows how to convert £1 'GBP' to 'EUR' at today's exchange rate.

```php
$exchangeRates = new ExchangeRate();
$result = $exchangeRates->convert(100, 'GBP', 'EUR', Carbon::now());

// $result: 110.15884906
```

Note: If a Carbon date is passed as the third parameter, the exchange rate for that day will be returned (if valid).
If no date is passed, today's exchange rate will be used.

##### Converting Between More Than Two Currencies
You can also use the ``` ->convert() ``` method to convert a monetary value from one currency to multiple currencies. To
do this, you can pass an array of currency codes strings as the third parameter.

The example below show how to convert £1 'GBP' to 'EUR' and 'USD' at today's exchange rate.

```php
$exchangeRates = new ExchangeRate();
$result = $exchangeRates->convert(100, 'GBP', ['EUR', 'USD'], Carbon::now());

// $result: [
//     'EUR' => 110.15884906,
//     'USD' => 125.30569081
// ];
```

#### Convert Currencies Between Date Range
When passing in the monetary value (first parameter) that is to be converted, it's important that you pass it in the lowest
denomination of that currency. For example, £1 GBP would be passed in as 100 (as £1 = 100 pence).

##### Converting Between Two Currencies in a Date Range
Similar to getting the exchange rates between a date range, you can also get convert monetary values from one currency to
another using the exchange rates. To do this you can use the ``` ->convertBetweenDateRange() ``` method.

The example below shows how to convert £1 'GBP' to 'EUR' using the exchange rates for the past 3 days.

```php
$exchangeRates = new ExchangeRate();
$exchangeRates->convertBetweenDateRange(100, 'GBP', 'EUR', Carbon::now()->subDays(3), Carbon::now());

// $result: [
//     '2020-07-07' => 110.92623405,
//     '2020-07-08' => 111.20625424,
//     '2020-07-09' => 111.53867604,
// ];
```

##### Converting Between More Than Two Currencies in a Date Range

You can also use the ``` ->convertBetweenDateRange() ``` method to convert a monetary value from one currency to multiple currencies
using the exchange rates between a date range. To do this, you can pass an array of currency codes strings as the third parameter.

The example below show how to convert £1 'GBP' to 'EUR' and 'USD' at the past three days' exchange rates.

```php
$exchangeRates = new ExchangeRate();
$result = $exchangeRates->exchangeRateBetweenDateRange('GBP', ['EUR', 'USD'], Carbon::now()->subDays(3), Carbon::now());

// $result: [
//     '2020-07-07' => [
//         'EUR' => 110.92623405,
//         'USD' => 125.23571825,
//      ],
//     '2020-07-08' => [
//         'EUR' => 111.20625424,
//         'USD' => 125.50737853,
//      ],
//     '2020-07-09' => [
//         'EUR' => 111.53867604,
//         'USD' => 126.50716636,
//      ],
// ];
```

### Facade
If you prefer to use facades in Laravel, you can choose to use the provided ```ExchangeRate ``` facade instead of instantiating the ``` AshAllenDesign\LaravelExchangeRates\Classes\ExchangeRate ```
class manually.

The example below shows an example of how you could use the facade to get the available currencies:

```php
<?php
    
    namespace App\Http\Controllers;
    
    use ExchangeRate;
    
    class TestController extends Controller
    {
        public function index()
        {
            return ExchangeRate::currencies();
        }
    }
```

### Validation Rule
Laravel Exchange Rates comes with its own ``` ValidCurrency ``` rule for validating currencies. This can be useful for if you need to be sure
that a currency (maybe one provided by the user) is supported by the library. The example below show how you can use the
rule for validating the currency.

```php
<?php
    
    namespace App\Http\Controllers;
    
    use AshAllenDesign\LaravelExchangeRates\Rules\ValidCurrency;
    use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Validator;

    class TestController extends Controller
    {
        public function index()
        {
            $formData = [
                'currency' => 'GBP',
            ];
    
            $rules = [
                'currency' => new ValidCurrency,
            ];
    
            $validator = Validator::make($formData, $rules);
        }
    }
```



### Examples
This example shows how to convert 100 pence (£1) from Great British Pounds to Euros. The current exchange rate will be used (unless a cached rate for this date already exists).
```php
<?php
    
    namespace App\Http\Controllers;
    
    use AshAllenDesign\LaravelExchangeRates\Classes\ExchangeRate;
    
    class TestController extends Controller
    {
        public function index()
        {
            $exchangeRates = new ExchangeRate();
            return $exchangeRates->convert(100, 'GBP', 'EUR', Carbon::now());
        }
    }
```

### Caching
#### Busting Cached Exchange Rates
By default, the responses all of the requests to the [exchangeratesapi.io](http://exchangeratesapi.io) API are cached.
This allows for significant performance improvements and reduced bandwidth from your server. 

However, if for any reason you require a fresh result from the API and not a cached result, the ``` ->shouldBustCache() ```
method can be used. The example below shows how to ignore the cached value (if one exists) and make a new API request.

```php
<?php
    
    namespace App\Http\Controllers;
    
    use AshAllenDesign\LaravelExchangeRates\Classes\ExchangeRate;
    
    class TestController extends Controller
    {
        public function index()
        {
            $exchangeRates = new ExchangeRate();
            return $exchangeRates->shouldBustCache()->convert(100, 'GBP', 'EUR', Carbon::now());
        }
    }
```

#### Preventing Exchange Rates from Being Cached
It is also possible to prevent the exchange rates from being cached at all. To do this, you can use the ``` ->shouldCache(false) ```
method. The example below shows how to get an exchange rate and not cache it:

```php
<?php
    
    namespace App\Http\Controllers;
    
    use AshAllenDesign\LaravelExchangeRates\Classes\ExchangeRate;
    
    class TestController extends Controller
    {
        public function index()
        {
            $exchangeRates = new ExchangeRate();
            return $exchangeRates->shouldCache(false)->convert(100, 'GBP', 'EUR', Carbon::now());
        }
    }
```

Note: The caching works by storing exchange rates after fetching them from the API. As an example, if you were to fetch
the exchange rates for 'GBP' to 'EUR' for 20-11-2019 - 27-11-2019, the rates between these dates will be cached as a single
cache item. This cache item will only be retrieved if you attempt to fetch the same exchange rates on with the exact same
currencies and date range.

Therefore, if you were to try and get 'GBP' to 'EUR' for 20-11-2019 - 26-11-2019, a new API request would be made because
the date range is different.
